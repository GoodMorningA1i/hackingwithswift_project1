# Project 1 of Hacking With Swift

## About the Project

An app that lets a user browse through images on their phone.

More specifically, its an iOS app that holds rows of image names in a table. When a row in the table is selected, it navigates to a new screen with the image to view.

This project covers topics like table views and image views, app bundles, FileManager, typecasting, view controllers, storyboards, outlets, Auto Layout, UIImage, and more.

### Built With

Xcode, Swift, Apple's UIKit framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install XCode

### Getting the files onto your computer

Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or GitHub Desktop. 

For example, this is how using git could potentially look like: 
```
https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
```

You should replace `your_username` and `project_name` respectively.

### Running the project

1. Get started by opening up the project in XCode by clicking on the file ending with `.xcodeproj`.
2. Once the project is open in Xcode, you can select a device (ex. iPhone 15) and run it on a simulator by pressing Cmd + R or clicking on the play button at the top-left corner of the screen.
